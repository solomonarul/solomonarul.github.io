When you've got as many factories as when playing as Japan in this mod, it's easy to just spam good tanks, especially after creating the East Overworld Company.

I know I could've made this 35-width by adding an anti-tank and another tank but this felt punchy enough to deal with the hordes that late game Ominous Consortium put out so I didn't bother. Plus default AI tanks are trash anyway.

They had almost everything the West Overworld Company has in the image as core teritory. _Yikes._

Helicopters are an _absolute necesity_ to survive the supply hell that this mod creates. Also important is CAS, I was stuck with the 653 (Improved) plane designs because I forgot to change them to Advanced. {{< emoji "eto-bleh.webp" >}}

Pretty good campaign, decent focus tree, worthy enough for me to start making this series. Also made me actually think before using my navy, so definatelly a good way to learn that.

I haven't taken any other pictures during this tho as I've come up with the idea to start documenting my games only after I finished this one.
