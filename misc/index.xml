<p>When you&rsquo;ve got as many factories as when playing as Japan in this mod, it&rsquo;s easy to just spam good tanks, especially after creating the East Overworld Company.</p>
<p>I know I could&rsquo;ve made this 35-width by adding an anti-tank and another tank but this felt punchy enough to deal with the hordes that late game Ominous Consortium put out so I didn&rsquo;t bother. Plus default AI tanks are trash anyway.</p>
<p>They had almost everything the West Overworld Company has in the image as core teritory. <em>Yikes.</em></p>
<p>Helicopters are an <em>absolute necesity</em> to survive the supply hell that this mod creates. Also important is CAS, I was stuck with the 653 (Improved) plane designs because I forgot to change them to Advanced. <img src="/emojis/eto-bleh.gif" class="inline-emoji" /></p>
<p>Pretty good campaign, decent focus tree, worthy enough for me to start making this series. Also made me actually think before using my navy, so definatelly a good way to learn that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t taken any other pictures during this tho as I&rsquo;ve come up with the idea to start documenting my games only after I finished this one.</p>
